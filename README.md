## About
Starter Kit is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.
It is built on [Scotch\box](https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-box), to provide a simplistic start to any web development project. This kit is built to be used in conjunction with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to automate different tasks as a web developer.

## Technologies

- [**Vagrant**](https://www.vagrantup.com/) - Development Environments Made Easy
- [**Scotch\box**](https://box.scotch.io/) - The Perfect / Easiest Local Dev Environment
- [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org) - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [**Gulp**](http://gulpjs.com) - Automate and enhance your workflow.
- [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) - Fast, Reliable, and secure dependency management.

## Requirements

- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

```bash
npm install -g gulp yarn bower
```

Using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install Virtualbox and Vagrant:

```powershell
cinst -y virtualbox virtualbox.extensionpack vagrant
```

Gulp is the process that will run all the task of compilation, watchers, and others. Bower will get the dependencies for the client-side like jQuery. Yarn is an alternative to npm for dependency managment. It is much more reliable when compared to npm, so we will use yarn for dependency management instead of npm. Virtualbox and Vagrant are used for the spin-up development environment. Those are the only requirements to run this project.

## Install
In order to start using this project, you need to clone/download it to your machine.

## Set Up/Workflow
Now after you have cloned/downloaded the kit to a desirable location, you will need to navigate to the `Starter Kit` folder using terminal and execute the following commands to gather all the dependencies, bring up the vagrant box and open `Gulp Help`.

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /var/www
gem install travis
yarn install && bower install
gulp help
```
After the processes finish, you can now proceed into the `How to Use` section to understand each option the kit presents to you.

## How to use
To start using the kit, open the project on the code editor of your choice and start coding.

To compile and live-preview all of your changes, you have some commands that will help you. Here is a list of commands you should know.

Every command has to be executed on the root directory of the project using the gulp command like `gulp clean` or `gulp build`.

* **start**: Compile and watch for changes (For dev.)
* **clean**: Removes all the compiled files in public/
* **ftp**: Deploy to an FTP/SFTP server
* **surge**: Deploy to a Surge.sh domain
* **ghpages**: Deploy to Github-Pages
* **js**: Compile the JavaScript files
* **pug**: Compile the Pug templates
* **sass**: Compile the SASS styles
* **images**: Transfer and minify any image/favicon to public/
* **vendors**: Transfer vendors to public/
* **build**: build the project (for prod.)
* **watch**: Watch for any changes
* **pagespeed**: Run Google PageSpeed Insights
* **help**: Print a list of available Gulp tasks
* **browserSync**: Start the browser-sync server

If you are in the development process, the `gulp start` command is the best option for you. Go to the project folder in the console and execute `gulp start`, it will compile the project and start server that will refresh every time you change something in the code. The command will be waiting for changes and will tell you how to access the project from local and public url. Every browser that points to that url will be auto refreshed. As an extra feature for testing purpose any interaction on one browser will be reflected on any others. Try it on a phone, tablet, and pc at the same time.

## Structure
The project has a very simple and flexible structure. If the default place for any file or directory needs to be moved, be sure to update the new position on the config file.

```
â”œâ”€â”€â”€gulp -> The containing folder for all things 'gulp'
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€tasks -> All of the different gulp tasks used in 'gulpfile.js'
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€base -> basic tasks, such as 'help' and 'watch'
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€build -> tasks used for compiling 'pug' or 'sass'

â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€partials/ -> Contains the main `_head.pug` and `_scripts.pug` file(s)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€layouts/ -> Contains the main '_layout.pug' file to be added as an 'extension' to the 'index.pug' file
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€â”€index.pug -> Un-Compiled Pug file
â”œâ”€â”€â”€.bowerrc -> Defines where the dependencies will be installed
â”œâ”€â”€â”€bower.json -> Bower configuration file for managing bower dependencies

```
All the files in the dist folder will be auto-generated by the different tasks when you compile the project. Be sure to not modify any files manually in the dist folder because changes will be replaced in the compilation process.

## Configuration
This project has some nice configuration options to meet all you needs. To configure, you will need to edit the `./gulp/config.js` file and change any value you need. Every aspect of this configuration is described in the file so that you can understand their functions.
