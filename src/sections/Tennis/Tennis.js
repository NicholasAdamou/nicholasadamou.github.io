During this time, I have known Nick to be extremely diligent and proficient in his approach with everything that he does. Nick applied to Hartwick and received the top scholarship at that institution and joined our team.",

He has clearly succeeded at two liberal arts colleges and is an example of the best type of student that this environment can produce. He is active on campus and is a leader on our team.",

He has done so much not only in his time at Cornell, but also back in NY. He has had a big impact on this team and Cornell. He is going to do great things in the world with all of his crazy computer stuff (that he is really good at + really hard for everyone else). I believe with my whole heart that Nick will continue to have an impact on everyone and every thing he will do.",
